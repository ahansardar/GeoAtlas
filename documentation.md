## Work Log

### 2026-06-17 - CSV Source Import

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Let users upload a CSV to add many RSS sources, review/select rows before import, and decide how duplicate links should be handled.

**What changed:**
- `backend/app/schemas.py`: Added optional source language fields for create/update payloads.
- `backend/app/services.py`: Applies a CSV-provided language override when creating a source.
- `backend/static/index.html`: Added the CSV import panel with file input, duplicate mode, select-all, clear, import, summary, and preview area.
- `backend/static/styles.css`: Added CSV preview table styling, row states, and duplicate/invalid badges.
- `backend/static/app.js`: Added CSV parsing, required-column validation, duplicate detection, row selection, select-all behavior, skip/override duplicate modes, and selected-row import.
- `docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Documented CSV format, behavior, and field mapping.

**How to run or verify:**
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Enter a generated admin key and refresh sources.
- Upload a CSV with columns `source name`, `base url`, `category`, `region`, and `language`.
- Select or unselect individual rows, or use `Select all`.
- Choose `Skip existing links` or `Override existing links`.
- Click `Import selected`.

**Output or result:**
- CSV rows are previewed before import.
- Invalid rows are disabled.
- Existing links are flagged as duplicates.
- Selected new rows are added as sources.
- Selected duplicate rows are either skipped or overridden based on the selected duplicate mode.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Duplicate detection currently compares CSV `base url` to stored `feed_url`. If a website URL redirects or discovers a feed URL already stored under a different URL, the backend may still report it as duplicate during save.
- Add a backend bulk-import endpoint later if imports become large enough to need server-side batching.

### 2026-06-17 - Detected Time Zone Display

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Translate displayed timestamps in the GeoAtlas Source Console into the browser-detected time zone.

**What changed:**
- `backend/static/index.html`: Added a visible detected time-zone status chip in the top toolbar.
- `backend/static/app.js`: Added browser time-zone detection, localized timestamp formatting, and recursive timestamp conversion for JSON output preview fields.

**How to run or verify:**
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Confirm the top toolbar shows the detected time zone.
- Check source cards, detected sample items, and JSON output preview timestamps.

**Output or result:**
- The UI detected `Asia/Calcutta` in the current browser session.
- Output preview timestamps are displayed with `GMT+5:30`.
- Browser console showed no errors after reload.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Add a manual time-zone override if analysts need to inspect output in another time zone.

### 2026-06-17 - Source Console UI And Functionality Pass

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Improve the GeoAtlas Source Console so adding feeds, loading sources, triggering ingestion, and reading output are clearer and less brittle.

**What changed:**
- `backend/static/index.html`: Added API docs link, message bar, admin-key visibility toggle, generated-key hint, clear button, source search/status filters, output source selector, copy-output button, and output summary.
- `backend/static/styles.css`: Added layout and state styles for the new controls, notices, toolbars, selected candidates, danger actions, and mobile behavior.
- `backend/static/app.js`: Reworked UI state management for admin-key loading, source filtering, selectable feed candidates, save/run/archive/view actions, scoped output refresh, JSON copy, and clearer error/success messages.

**How to run or verify:**
- Start the API from `backend` with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Paste a generated admin key and refresh sources.
- Detect an RSS feed, save it, run ingestion, and confirm output JSON updates.
- Reload the page and check browser console errors.

**Output or result:**
- UI loads with `geoatlas-data-collection: DB ok`.
- Admin key loads protected source data from Supabase.
- RSS detection displays selectable candidates and sample items.
- Saving a source, running ingestion, and scoped output preview work from the UI.
- Browser console showed no errors after reload.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Add a dedicated admin-key management screen if key rotation needs to happen from the browser.
- Add pagination or cursor controls once source/output volume grows.

### 2026-06-17 - Backend Folder And Database Admin Keys

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Move backend code into a dedicated `backend/` folder and replace the fixed environment admin key with generated admin keys stored in Supabase/Postgres.

**What changed:**
- `backend/`: Moved the FastAPI app, static source console, schema SQL, requirements, and local environment example into the backend folder.
- `backend/app/admin_keys.py`: Added admin key generation, hashing, storage, and validation helpers.
- `backend/app/models.py`: Added the `admin_api_keys` model.
- `backend/app/main.py`: Changed admin route validation to check `X-Admin-Key` against active hashed keys in the database.
- `backend/scripts/generate_admin_key.py`: Added a script that generates a plaintext key, stores only its hash in Supabase/Postgres, and prints the plaintext once.
- `backend/db/geoatlas_data_collection_schema.sql`: Added the `admin_api_keys` table and active-key index.
- `backend/static/index.html`: Updated the Admin key placeholder to refer to generated GeoAtlas admin keys.
- `.gitignore`: Updated ignores for backend-local `.env` and SQLite files.
- `docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Documented the new backend folder layout and admin key generation flow.

**How to run or verify:**
- Run `cd backend`.
- Run `python scripts/generate_admin_key.py --name local-admin`.
- Start the API with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Paste the generated key into the GeoAtlas Source Console admin key field.
- Call an admin endpoint such as `GET /api/v1/sources` with `X-Admin-Key`.

**Output or result:**
- Admin keys are now database-backed and can be rotated by generating a new key.
- The backend is now contained in the `backend/` folder.
- `admin_api_keys` exists in Supabase/Postgres and has one active generated key.
- A valid generated key successfully authenticated `GET /api/v1/sources`.
- An invalid key was rejected with HTTP 401.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Add an admin-only key revocation/listing endpoint if key management needs to happen through the UI.
- Add role/scope support if multiple admin key permission levels are needed.

### 2026-06-17 - Supabase Pooler Connection

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Replace the unreachable direct Supabase Postgres URL with the IPv4-compatible Supabase pooler URI and verify GeoAtlas can use Supabase Postgres.

**What changed:**
- `backend/.env`: Updated `DATABASE_URL` to use the Supabase pooler host. This file is ignored by git and must not be committed.
- Supabase Postgres: GeoAtlas startup created or verified the core data collection tables.
- Supabase Postgres: Applied `backend/db/geoatlas_data_collection_schema.sql` to enable the full table/index shape for the data collection service.

**How to run or verify:**
- Run a SQLAlchemy connection check against `DATABASE_URL`.
- Restart the API with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Call `GET /health`.
- Query `information_schema.tables` for core GeoAtlas data collection tables.
- Call `GET /api/v1/public/items`.

**Output or result:**
- SQLAlchemy connected to Supabase Postgres through the pooler.
- `/health` returned `status: ok` and `database: ok`.
- Core tables found: `external_sources`, `ingestion_jobs`, `ingestion_logs`, `raw_fetched_items`, `normalized_items`, `normalized_item_locations`, and `event_candidates`.
- Expected indexes were created, including trigram and PostGIS GIST indexes.
- Public items endpoint responded with an empty list from the connected database.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Add a migration system before production changes accumulate.

### 2026-06-17 - Supabase Postgres URL Attempt

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Configure `DATABASE_URL` using the Supabase Postgres password and verify whether GeoAtlas can connect directly to Supabase Postgres.

**What changed:**
- `.env`: Set `DATABASE_URL` to the Supabase direct Postgres connection string using the local password. This file is ignored by git and must not be committed.
- `backend/app/main.py`: Moved database table creation into startup and made `/health` report database errors as degraded health instead of crashing the whole API.
- `docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Added a note about using the Supabase pooler connection string when direct IPv6 database access is not available.

**How to run or verify:**
- Restart the API with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Call `GET /health`.
- Test DNS and network access for the direct Supabase database host.

**Output or result:**
- Supabase API keys are configured and the API service starts.
- `DATABASE_URL` is configured as a Postgres URL.
- Direct DB connection failed from this machine because the Supabase direct database host resolves to IPv6 and the local network cannot reach that IPv6 address.
- `/health` now reports database status as `error` with service status `degraded` instead of letting the app crash on startup.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Replace `DATABASE_URL` with the Supabase IPv4-compatible connection pooler URI from Project Settings -> Database -> Connection string.
- After the pooler URL is added, restart the API and recheck `/health` for `database: ok`.

### 2026-06-17 - Supabase Environment Wiring

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Add the Supabase project URL and API keys to the local runtime environment and make the backend aware of the Supabase configuration.

**What changed:**
- `.env`: Added `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` locally. This file is ignored by git and should not be committed.
- `backend/app/config.py`: Added Supabase URL, anon key, and service-role key settings.
- `backend/app/main.py`: Extended `/health` to report whether Supabase URL/API keys are configured without exposing secret values.
- `.env.example`: Added placeholder Supabase environment variables for future developers.
- `docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Documented the difference between Supabase API keys and the Postgres `DATABASE_URL`.

**How to run or verify:**
- Start the API with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Call `GET /health` and confirm Supabase settings show as configured.
- Set `DATABASE_URL` to the Supabase Postgres connection string when ready to store data in Supabase Postgres.

**Output or result:**
- Supabase project API settings are available to the backend through environment variables.
- Local `/health` reports Supabase URL, anon key, and service-role key as configured.
- Supabase REST root was reachable with the service-role key and returned HTTP 200.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- A real Supabase Postgres connection still requires the database password or full pooled connection string in `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2026-06-17 - GeoAtlas Data Collection First Build

**Developer:** Ahan

**Goal:** Build the first usable data collection slice for GeoAtlas where an internal user can add RSS/Atom feed links, let the backend auto-detect feed content, ingest entries, store output, and expose public API output without building a public news frontend.

**What changed:**
- `backend/app/main.py`: Added FastAPI routes for feed detection, source CRUD, manual ingestion, job lookup, public items, public events, public sources, JSON export, health, OpenAPI, and the internal source console.
- `backend/app/feed_utils.py`: Added RSS/Atom fetching, URL safety checks, private-network blocking, XML parsing, HTML feed discovery, item hashing, simple category hints, and simple location hints.
- `backend/app/services.py`: Added source detection, source creation, synchronous manual ingestion, raw item storage, normalized item creation, and event candidate creation.
- `backend/app/models.py`: Added SQLAlchemy models for sources, ingestion jobs, raw fetched items, normalized items, and event candidates.
- `backend/app/schemas.py`: Added Pydantic request and response models for admin APIs and public output APIs.
- `backend/static/index.html`, `backend/static/styles.css`, `backend/static/app.js`: Added the internal GeoAtlas Source Console for adding feeds, detecting metadata, saving sources, triggering ingestion, and previewing public JSON output.
- `backend/db/geoatlas_data_collection_schema.sql`: Added Supabase Postgres + PostGIS SQL schema and indexes for the data collection slice.
- `backend/.env.example`: Added GeoAtlas runtime environment variables.
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Added Python dependencies for the FastAPI service.
- `.gitignore`: Added local environment, cache, and SQLite database ignores.
- `docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Added run instructions, endpoint list, Supabase setup notes, admin key notes, public output contract, and current limits.
- `README.md`, `HLD.md`: Linked the runnable implementation notes and aligned data collection language with GeoAtlas naming.

**How to run or verify:**
- Run `cd backend`.
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Start the API with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to use the GeoAtlas Source Console.
- Check health with `GET /health`.
- Detect a feed with `POST /api/v1/sources/detect`.
- Add a feed with `POST /api/v1/sources/rss`.
- Trigger ingestion with `POST /api/v1/sources/{source_id}/ingest`.
- Read output with `GET /api/v1/public/items` or `GET /api/v1/public/export.json`.

**Output or result:**
- Local API health returned `{"status":"ok","database":"ok","service":"geoatlas-data-collection"}`.
- Browser UI rendered as `GeoAtlas Source Console`.
- RSS detection was verified with NASA's RSS feed.
- Manual ingestion produced normalized public items and event candidates.

**Known issues or follow-ups:**
- Manual ingestion currently runs synchronously inside the API request; move it to a scheduler/worker for production.
- RSS parsing is dependency-light and should later be upgraded with stronger article extraction and feed compatibility.
- Location extraction is currently simple keyword matching; replace with a geocoder or NLP pipeline.
- Add automated tests around URL safety, feed detection, duplicate handling, and public output schemas.
